  ## No Mess Rollouts with Argo Rollouts and Gateway API
  
  Modern application delivery has many pitfalls: version transitions,
  traffic management, quality assurance, performance monitoring, and rollbacks.
  Argo Rollouts lets teams gradually and safely deploy new versions of applications.
  A standard Gateway API enables any provider to support Argo Rollouts without
  provider-specific code.


  This hands-on lab guides you on integrating Argo Rollouts using different Gateway API implementations.
  Using Argo and Gateway API resources (HTTPRoute),
  youâ€™ll learn to adjust traffic weights and gradually direct more traffic
  to a new version. We will also explore challenges in route delegation
  and role-based access control within Gateway API.

To setup run:
```
./setup-env.sh
```

To clean up the setup:
```
./teardown.sh
```
